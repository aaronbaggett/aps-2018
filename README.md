# Modeling Ability and Decision Difficulty Among Expert Baseball Umpires
Data and Code for APS 2018 Poster

# Abstract
Using a Rasch model, we estimated expert baseball umpires' ball/strike decision making ability and difficulty over the course of the 2015-2017 regular and postseasons. Pitch location was operationalized as a test item residing in one of 16 regions in and around the strike zone area.

# Summary
In baseball, home plate umpires' perceptual-cognitive skills are tested with each pitch as they are required to judge, with accuracy, whether the ball passed through the imaginary region above home plate known as the strike zone.  Home plate umpires must visually track the flight of a pitched ball as it leaves the pitcher's hand and travels over the home plate region to accurately determine whether a pitch should be called a strike or a ball. Among other variables influencing umpire decision making ability, the location of the pitch is of particular importance as pitchers routinely work to avoid the regions nearest home plate while favoring peripheral regions.

This current study applied literature related to judgment and decision making among expert sport performers to the professional baseball umpire population.  Using a Rasch model, we estimated expert baseball umpires' ball/strike decision making ability and difficulty over the course of the 2015-2017 regular and postseasons. Pitch location was operationalized as a test item residing in one of 16 regions in or around the strike zone area.

Three Rasch models were estimated: 1) all batters, regardless of handedness; 2) right-handed batters; and 3) left-handed batters. In addition to item difficulty parameters, predicted probabilities of umpire decision accuracy were obtained for each of the 16 pitch location regions. In addition to umpire ability parameters, differences between umpire decision accuracy for right- and left-handed batters will be presented.
